> The true Metaverse is not simply about ‘escaping reality,’ nor is it merely about creating a virtual space beyond the physical world. It involves the deep integration of the digital economy with the real economy, breaking physical boundaries, and eventually moving from virtual to reality to drive the comprehensive upgrade of the real economy. In this process, business models in limited scenarios can achieve a ‘second growth curve’ in infinite scenarios.

## Project Introduction

The 2024 Guangdong Fashion Week - Spring Venue underwent a comprehensive upgrade. I am honored to have been part of it and to have witnessed the use of XR virtual reality technology to depict the growth and spread of floral and botanical elements. This event introduced elements such as “digital fashion,” “eco-friendly,” and “natural art” from multiple dimensions, aiming to realize the core concepts of “aesthetic fusion,” “exploration of the future,” and “creative transcendence” in a virtual environment. Experiencing the artistic aesthetics of digital fashion in the Metaverse has become possible.

At the 2024 Guangdong Fashion Week - Spring main venue, I had the privilege of working with Guangdong Chance3d Technology Co., Ltd. to combine their Metaverse technology to create a multi-dimensional immersive experience. The deep integration of virtual and reality opened up new possibilities for shows, visual promotion, and experiential models. This creative clash and visual feast attracted numerous fashion industry professionals, contributing to the growth of Guangdong’s fashion scene and injecting more momentum into the fashion industry.
