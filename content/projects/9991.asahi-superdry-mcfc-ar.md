## Project Overview  
To celebrate **Asahi Super Dry's partnership with Manchester City**, Created by Catalyst delivered a captivating browser-based **AR experience** that transformed limited-edition Asahi cans into immersive portals to the stadium. Users scan the QR code on the can and interact with iconic footballers like Dias, Rodri, and AkÃ© â€” all without installing an app.

## My Role & Contributions  
I joined this project through Created by Catalyst team to deliver the **frontend WebAR implementation**, with a focus on:

- Developing the AR experience using **8th Wall**, configured for seamless browser use across global markets, including **WeChat in China**.  
- Implementing **asset compression and lazy loading** strategies to ensure high performance and fast loading on mobile.  
- Guaranteeing broad device compatibility so users could enjoy the experience without app installations or friction.

## Impact  
- Delivered a **smooth and shareable AR experience** designed for global accessibility.  
- Strengthened the intersection of **brand storytelling and immersive interactivity**, setting a high bar for fan engagement in campaign activations.
