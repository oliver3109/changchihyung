## Project Overview  
For Kylie Minogueâ€™s wine brand promotion, we developed a WebAR campaignâ€”build using 8thâ€¯Wallâ€”that lets fans take AR selfies with Kylie and decorate their photos with themed stickers. The interactive experience blends virtual and real worlds to drive star IP and brand engagement.

> Thanks to **Created by Catalyst** for the project opportunity provided.

## My Role & Contributions  
I focused on enhancing the AR sticker module and interaction logic:

- **Optimized the sticker overlay system**, improving performance and accuracy when placing and aligning stickers on user selfies.  
- **Implemented zoom and scale gestures**, allowing users to resize and reposition stickers fluidly.  
- **Improved interaction logic**, ensuring seamless touch experienceâ€”including drag, rotate, and layering behavior.  
- Collaborated closely with the catalyst team to ensure alignment with brand design and technical requirements.

## Impact  
- Delivered a **smooth, engaging AR photo feature** that boosted social sharing and user interaction.  
- Enhanced user experience with **intuitive sticker controls** and responsive AR overlays.  
- Strengthened the campaignâ€™s appeal by merging **celebrity branding with interactive technology**.
