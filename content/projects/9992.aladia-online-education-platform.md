## Aladia (Italy-based Online Education Platform)

During the development of **Aladia**, an allâ€‘inâ€‘one eâ€‘learning platform enabling users and organizations to create, sell, and manage courses globally [aladia.it](https://et.linkedin.com/company/aladiaa?trk=ppro_cprof&utm_source=chatgpt.com), I led front-end development on the course sales page and implemented critical platform features:

- Developed **course sales and detail pages**, integrating payment flows (Stripe), Q&A modules, chapter menus, media players, and course review systems.
    
- Built live and on-demand streaming support, chat features, third-party logins (e.g. Google OAuth), course-sharing capabilities, and schedule views.
    
- Contributed to advanced feature development: **AIGCâ€‘generated course outlines and categories**, course lifecycle and discount management, userâ€‘generated posts/Stories (akin to Instagram Stories), course space management (cloudâ€‘style storage), and live schedule administration.
    

I collaborated closely with backend engineers to ensure smooth integration and implemented front-end optimizations, improving **page load speed and overall platform responsiveness**.
