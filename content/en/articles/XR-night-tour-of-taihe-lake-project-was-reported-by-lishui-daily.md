The “XR Night Tour of Taihe Lake” project we created in Qingtian, Zhejiang, was recently covered in a follow-up report by Zhejiang Lishui Daily. This project combines the beautiful scenery of Taihe Lake with modern technology through the use of XR (Extended Reality) technology, providing tourists with an immersive night tour experience. The success of the project not only showcases our team’s innovation in the integration of XR technology and cultural tourism but also contributes to the construction of Qingtian’s Metaverse cultural tourism. We feel truly honored to have played a role in this process and to have helped Qingtian achieve a new breakthrough in the Metaverse cultural tourism field. In the future, we will continue to explore the deep integration of technology and culture, creating more engaging interactive experiences to inject new vitality into the cultural tourism industry.
