## Project Introduction
I am honored to collaborate with Zhejiang Chengshi Metaverse Technology Co., Ltd. to create the “Night Tour of Taihe Lake” XR cultural tourism project. Based on the night scenery of Taihe Lake, this project uses XR technology to create a highly immersive virtual space, offering visitors a unique visual and cultural experience.

## Project Achievements
This mini program is the<strong>first of its kind in Lishui City,</strong>a pioneering cultural tourism case that integrates XR large-space technology in the Metaverse. We are at the forefront of XR Metaverse cultural tourism large-space positioning technology nationwide, with the following notable achievements：
1. The mini program’s ease of use allows users to access and interact with it effortlessly.
2. The XR effects achieved have reached the best possible level within the capabilities of XR mini programs.
3. Strong ability to attract foot traffic and promote cultural content. On the Lantern Festival, our Metaverse XR “Wishing Dragon” check-in point on the popular bridge attracted a total of <strong>3,000</strong> visitors, and we received <strong> 14,200 </strong> viewing requests that day.

Through this project, I hope not only to showcase the beauty of Taihe Lake but also to promote the deep integration of culture and technology, injecting new vitality into the cultural tourism industry. I encourage everyone to explore the unique charm of the fusion of the virtual and the real through the Taihe Lake Night Tour AR Mini Program.

## “Taihe Mirage” Check-in Point
> In July 2024, we added an AR glasses check-in point, which is expected to be open to Qingtian residents for experience in the future. The performance on AR glasses is closer to that of a mobile phone, allowing for better visual effects compared to the web version.
